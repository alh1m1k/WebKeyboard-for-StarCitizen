Color differentiation:
modes -> gold
hostile+security -> red
gear -> chestnut 
pwr -> green
shield+counter -> white
scaner+com -> blue
action -> purpure


1 additional axis (probably not needed)
3 additional joystick
4 implement delta invalidate and redraw for header
5 implement staticRenderer in buffer draw bypass for animating backgrounds(direct draw if possible)
6 implement better handling of binary protocols on client
7 full binary protocol for joystick + separate handler for joystick state
8 handle multi client update of joystick (probably delta update with same base (sign))
9 implement mapping between kb task and kb symbol stream (allowing to reject or confirm succession of task execution)
10 for fun implement Attribute.createVersion and Registry.createVersion allowing to create versioned slice of data
11 configuration wnd bool widget must be refactor to take only actual size;
12 implement reset attribute ownership feature for ctrl-configuration window
13 improve Probe.move with variable precision
14 allow ping to disable echo(questionable)
15 make main settings are joint element (icon + title are all clickable)
18 reduce session sid size
21 report/notreport mbedtls_base64_encode have buffer like interface but behave like c-string processing function
    it want buffer of size (n+1) (probably for nil) and return error if buffer is (n) but it use only (n) bytes and return size of writed bytes as (n)
    mbedtls_base64_encode have 4 bytes align and requirements for (x*4)+1 buffer size is little unexpected.
23 add compile time size for resource (compressed)
24 move from global packet counter to session based
27 globaly ctrl object move to overship semantic it seems "variable must be valid until sent" is refer to http_sent not socket sent

notes:
dropped memory decompression iml
unable to keep default stack size, no easy way
unable to make file constexpr
socket call must be also refactored
file checksum will change on every build because it's how cmake file compress work

BUGS
1 move element to trash broke overlay aligment
2 chrome57 fix worker startup crash(missing feature)
3 change submit btn decouple size of button and line-height, set line-height = 2.5rem
4 check that when multipixel line in use border clip work correctly, most likely it is not.
5 check widget head at higth dpi
6 DHCP may fail after return success
